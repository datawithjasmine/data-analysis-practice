## ⭐️ Customer Insights Power BI Dashboard ⭐️

### 📌 Project Overview

I prompted ChatGPT to create a short dataset of customer transactions. I analyzed customer spending habits to make data-driven decisions.
It includes an interactive dashboard that tracks total purchases, spending trends, and customer classification. 

### 📊 Visuals

**Clustered Bar Chart** → To show customer spending distribution<br>
**Card Visuals** → To Display total sales, total purchases, and spender classification.<br>
**Dynamic Interactivity** → Clicking on a customer updates their insights

### 🛠️ Tools Used
**Power BI**<br>
**DAX for calculated columns**<br>
**Data Cleaning & Transformation**<br>

### 🔍 Analysis
When I got the data said, I loaded it into Power BI. From there, I changed the sales amount into currency. It wasn't needed but I wanted to practice data cleaning
skills. I prompted ChatGPT to ask me questions as if it was a stakeholder. In addition, I asked ChatGPT to help me create a DAX function, so that I can calculate who was a high spender and regular spender based on the critieria >$300. As I analyzed the visualization, the highest spender spent $400 and the lowest spender
spent $80. That's 5X less than the highest spender! I realized that customer spending was almost consistent. There was a $150 difference between the highest spender
and second highest spender. Are these customers buying one expensive item or are they frequenting the store? This made me wonder if we *really* needed a category of someone who was a high spender or regular spender. I added the total purchases
column to find out more about the data. Everyone tend to purchase the same amount of items. Some may purchase an expensive item. This store has frequent customers.
Now that I figured out that these were frequent customers and not people purchasing one off items, I devised a plan to incorporate a rewards program as the store
slightly increase their prices. The takeaway is that customers are still willing to purchase items at this store at a slightly higher price if they are rewarded
for visiting. I advise to test a small sample group before rolling out the rewards program. The idea is to advertise discounts and sales to their frequently purchased items as long as they purchased a similar item first.

### 💭 Comments
This was the first time I had the chance to create something in Power BI. It is still very overwhelming. I will continue to practice my skills, especially DAX functions.
I enjoyed the interactivity of the dashboard. It allows for the reports to be more personalized and detailed. Overall, I think I did an okay job. I cannot wait to get into
more deeper visualizations and analyses!
